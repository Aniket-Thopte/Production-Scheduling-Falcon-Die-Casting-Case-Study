# Production-Scheduling-Falcon-Die-Casting-Case-Study

• The main aim of this project is to develop & optimize Scheduling, to be done in a systematic manner along with certainty that the final schedule allocates processing of components for machines in an optimal manner.

• Since production employees are paid time & half for overtime work, our objective is on meeting the demand for the five parts with the least amount of overtime.

• The production scheduling is done for 12 consecutive weeks using Gurobi Optimizer (Python).

• This project also focuses on testing the effect of not shipping finished products to stock week by week.
